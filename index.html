            <h2>
              Iceland<br />
              The Land of Fire & Ice
            </h2>
            <p>
              Iceland, also called the Land of Fire and Ice, is home to glaciers
              and volcanos. The island was formed over millions of years ago and
              the landscapes are shaped by these two forces of nature. Active
              volcanoes, bright green valleys, glacier-cut fjords, black sand
              beaches, and roaring rivers are the most distinctive features of
              the landscape.
            </p>
            <p>
              The highlands are a sparsely inhabited plateau and studies show
              that 11% of the country is covered by glaciers, one of the main
              attractions in Iceland. Iceland is also home to Europe’s largest
              glacier, Vatnajökull, which is equivalent to three times the size
              of Luxembourg and covers about 8% of Iceland’s total landmass.
              Many of Iceland’s natural wonders are easily accessible and yet
              virtually untouched by humans. Route 1, or the Ring Road, runs
              around the island and is within reach of many of these sites.
